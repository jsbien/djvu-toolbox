djvu-compose 
============
ChatGPT:
The djvu-compose script is designed to efficiently compose a multi-page indirect DjVu document. The script's arguments are:

    INDEX (index DjVu file): The output file where the index of the DjVu document will be stored.
    PAGE (component DjVu files): One or more input DjVu files that will be included in the multi-page document.

All input files must be in the same directory as the output file. The script ensures that the resulting DjVu file is created efficiently, handling page sizes and writing the necessary metadata.

The -f option in the djvu-compose script forces the program to overwrite the output file if it already exists. Without this option, the script would prompt the user to confirm whether they want to overwrite the existing file or not. Using -f bypasses this prompt and automatically replaces the existing file with the new one.

djvu2txtsed
===========
ChatGPT:
The djvu2txtsed script processes the text output from a DjVu file, where 'select' marks the beginning of a new page. The script intersperses the text with incremental page numbers, making it easier to track where each page's content begins in the extracted text. This is particularly useful for ensuring that the text remains organized and paginated when extracted from a multi-page DjVu document.
